Convert a CNG key to a CSP key. Export the certificate to a PFX. then:

openssl pkcs12 -in <pathTo.pfx> -out <somefile>.pem
openssl pkcs12 -export -in <somefile>.pem -out <aNewPfx>.pfx

Self-Signed PowerShell CA Commands:
----------Create Root CA:
$params = @{
	DnsName = "Test Root CA"
	Subject = "CN=Test Root CA, O=Test Lab, C=CA
	KeyLength = 2048
	KeyAlgorithm = "RSA"
	HashAlgorithm = "SHA256"
	KeyExportPolicy = "Exportable"
	NotAfter = (Get-Date).AddYears(10)
	CertStoreLocation = "Cert:\LocalMachine\My"
	KeyUsage = "CertSign","CRLSign"
}
New-SelfSignedCertificate @params

-------------Create a new cert signed by the new root:
---- Get the new root Certificate:
$rootCert = Get-ChildItem | where  { $_.Subject -eq "CN=Test Root CA" }

---- Create the new cert signed by the root:
$params = @{
	DnsName = "*.testserver.net","san1","san2"
	Subject = "CN=Some Name, O=Some Org, C=CA"
	Signer = $rootCert
	KeyLength = 2048
	KeyAlgorithm = "RSA"
	HashAlgorithm = "SHA256"
	KeyExportPolicy = "Exportable"
	NotAfter = (Get-date).AddYears(2)
	CertStoreLocation = "Cert:\LocalMachine\My"
}
New-SelfSignedCertificate @params
